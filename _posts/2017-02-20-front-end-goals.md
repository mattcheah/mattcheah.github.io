title: Front-End Goals

My purpose in joining the software development program at Bloc was to learn to be a better developer with more options for how I could accomplish something. I have worked previously on designing websites and have not ever needed to use any technology that was not the standard 10 years ago. This limited my ability to learn and to keep up with an industry that is always coming out with new technologies to help developers do greater things, faster. 

My primary goals as I progress through the front-end program are to gain as much understanding of the deeper conceptual side of Javascript as possible while also being more comfortable with making configuration edits in the console - something I know I'll be required to do when I have shell access on my own server. Since mostly everything for web development is built on javascript now, I know that I'll be well prepared to understand new libraries or frameworks as I come across them as long as I have a comprehensive understanding of how javascript works. 

I understand that no course will be able to teach me everything I'll need to know and prepare me for every piece of code that I'll encounter, but if I have both the knowledge of how concepts are applied in Javascript, and the experience working with them so that I can solidify that knowledge in my mind when I am required to use it again, I think I'll be able to do just fine.
