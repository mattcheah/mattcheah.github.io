I'll just throw this one out there - I'm a terrible designer. I can't make something look good if my life depended on it, and unfortunately for me, and many others out there who are just like me, we sometimes get drawn into this world of design because people expect it of us. The true issue I suppose, is that we're forced to learn to use programs like photoshop or illustrator (or erm... mspaint?) to create little graphics for our websites that we hope aren't going to be there forever because we foolishly assume that someone will come along, see how bad it looks, and agree that you need to hire a designer. When your boss inexplicably responds to the draft of your website you've thrown up on a development server with a "Looks wonderful! Lets set it live!", our hopes and dreams of a good looking website are crushed and all of a sudden you've become the whiz-kid with a good eye for design. "Hey Matt, I need some flyers made. Can I count on you to do this within the next 30 minutes?" 

Of course designers have it much worse than this, I know (Including dealing with people who don't feel like paying for design services is a necessity). However, you don't get to complain too much, designers. At least the stuff that you make LOOKS good. I can create a functional website just fine, but it's not like a functional website all of a sudden creates a good user experience unless the design can convey the message that your marketing team needs it to. Your design needs to be accessible and lead the user toward the next action. It needs to be consistent with the message that it sends and the visual appeal that it provides. It needs to avoid clutter that distracts the user, and it just needs to look good. I'm a terrible designer, and I can't do that. And when I can't do that, your website or app will suck.

I suppose this is a shoutout to designers - no one appreciates you enough. No one appreciates how long and hard you work testing different looks, no one you appreciates writing that 100-page style guide that no one has ever read. No one appreciates that you usually work for far less than you should, because your work is freaking amazing and there are very few people who can do what you do. Learning to use Illustrator alone is not enough. I know. I'm a living example.
